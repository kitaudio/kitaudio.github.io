An additive synth based on the Web Audio API

<span> src folder is structured as follows: </span>
  <span> src/synth contains the audio synthesis modules</span>
  <span> src/widgets contains the UI widget modules</span>
  <span> src/controllers contains the controllers that bind the UI with the synthesis engine</span>
  <span>  src/app.js is the main entry point</span>
  
Chrome is highly recommended for full Web Audio API support
