Additor
=======
An additive synth app based on the Web Audio API
------------------------------------------------

src folder is structured as follows:
src/synth contains the audio synthesis modules
src/widgets contains the UI widget modules
src/controllers contains the controllers that bind the UI with the synthesis engine
src/app.js is the main entry point
Chrome is highly recommended for full Web Audio API support
