Additor
=======
An additive synth app based on the Web Audio API
------------------------------------------------

Additor is an additive synth built with vanilla JS using the Web Audio API.

The **src** folder is structured as follows:

**src/synth** contains modules pertaining to the audio synthesis engine

**src/widgets** contains classes for the canvas-based widgets

**src/controllers** contains controllers linking the UI with the synthesis engine

*note: Chrome is highly recommended for full Web Audio API support*
